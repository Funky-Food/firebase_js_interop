<!-- TODO: Make this pretty -->

- Match the file structure of the JS SDKs
- Docs should be verbatim copied from JS SDKs
- Comment the expected signature of JSFunctions
- If there are multiple function definitions with the same name, choose the most flexible one
- Do not write interop for deprecated or outdated code (ex functions v1)
